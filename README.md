# Introduction
Predicting house prices is a common and valuable task in the real estate industry. In this project, based on Amiesh Agarwal's Medium blog post, we will take the Housing dataset, which contains information about different houses in Boston, and build a linear regression model to predict house prices in California. 

# Features
Here are some of the key features of this repository:

Linear Regression Model: We build and train a linear regression model using the Housing dataset to predict house prices in California.

Data Analysis: Detailed data analysis and visualization to gain insights into the relationships between housing prices and various factors like location, population, income, and more.

Jupyter Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations of the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

Scikit-Learn: Utilizes Scikit-Learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, for model building and evaluation. The data comes from sklearn datasets.
